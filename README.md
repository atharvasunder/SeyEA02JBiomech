Fundamental Spring Mass Running Model

This is an implementation of a paper titled "A movement criterion for running" authored by Andre Seyfarth and Hartmut Geyer, which formalized the fundamental criterion for human running, which are: 
1. spring-like leg operation
2. a minimum running speed
3. a proper adjustment of leg stiffness and angle of attack.

Run the main MATLAB file (main_event_detection.m) and uncomment lines corresponding to the plot you require.
animation.m: Visualization of the motion of the spring mass model with plots for position, velocity, acceleration.
visualization_poincare.m , visualization.m: Plots the return map and other plots from the paper.
