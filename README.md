Fundamental Spring Mass Running Model

This is an implementation of a paper titled "A movement criterion for running" authored by Andre Seyfarth and Hartmut Geyer, which formalized the fundamental criterion for human running, which are: 
1. spring-like leg operation
2. a minimum running speed
3. a proper adjustment of leg stiffness and angle of attack.
